1. As Bob (a businessman), I want the app to be able to display my itinerary, so I can see my entire day laid out in front of me.

2. As Bob (a businessman), I want to set when I would be travelling so I can make sure I don't have intervening business plans that will be affected by the trip.

3. As Joseph (a traveller), I want to set where I would be traveling to make sure I am not making the same type of trip or visiting the same place or area again because I want to explore as much as I possibly can.
