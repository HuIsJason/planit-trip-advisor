# Release Goals

By the end of the semester, we plan to release a fully functional Planit application except for user stories 16 and 18. User story 18 revolves around users being able to personally review past experiences they had. After discussing this with the product owner, it was decided that this was not a crucial task; although it may eventually become part of the scope, it is not being prioritized over the other stories in sprints 1, 2, and 3. Furthermore, the product owner has confirmed that user story 16 is out of the scope of this project.

# User Story Priority

This has been completed in JIRA.

Additionally, we used planning poker to determine the number of points per story on JIRA.
