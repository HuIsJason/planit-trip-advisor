# Release Goals

By the end of the semester, we plan to release a fully functional Planit application except for user stories 16 and 18. User story 18 revolves around users being able to personally review past experiences they had. After discussing this with the product owner, it was decided that this was not a crucial task; although it may eventually become part of the scope, it is not being prioritized over the other stories in sprints 1, 2, and 3. Furthermore, the product owner has confirmed that user story 16 is out of the scope of this project.

Having said this, we expect to complete user stories 1-15 and 17 by the final release. For this release (sprint 1), we expect to complete the following user stories:

1. Setting of travel date and time
2. Setting of travel location/proximity
15. Itinerary display

# User Story Priority

High Priority:
1. Setting of travel date and time
2. Setting of travel location/proximity
7. Location/map display
9. Fastest route display
13. Itinerary Modification
15. Itinerary display

Medium Priority:
3. Setting of transportation method
4. Setting of trip distance(s)
5. Viewing of trip cost/budget
6. Viewing of trip activites
8. Viewing of trip total time
10. Individual event cost display
11. Travel time between events display
12. Activity/event time display
14. Itinerary sync to personal calendar
17. Rate events

This has been completed in JIRA as well.

Additionally, we used planning poker to determine the number of points per story on JIRA.
