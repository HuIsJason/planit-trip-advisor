## What Worked Well ##

The use of REST for interaction between the front and back end components of our application proved to be a good choice for our team; it allowed for simultaneous development between the two teams, and very little dependency upon one another. There were some hiccups in our documentation of this process, but in general REST was a successful technique for our team.

Furthermore, our team was quick to communicate with one another and held consistent meetings to address plans and issues that arose throughout the project. 

Finally, by focusing on both front and back end development, we were able to implement a product that was both functional and looked good. We believe that this elevated us above other groups that had simple or even inadequate user interfaces because of their focus on merely functionality.

## What Did Not Work Well ##

As a group, we struggled to keep our GitHub repository maintained. In hindsight, it would have been a good idea to use separate repositories for the front and back end teams. Because we did not learn about Gitflow until we had already completed a significant amount of the project, merge conflicts and poor commits were common and frustrating to resolve.

Additionally, learning React Native on the fly while trying to implement a complicated mobile application proved to be challenging for two of the three front end developers in our team. 

Finally, the documentation for Google Maps API was outdated and resulted in confusion for our backend team. Although this API was required for our project, there were a number of further issues that arose while using it in addition to the inadequate documentation. Due to the complicated algorithm that we implemented to create an itinerary, many API calls were required to complete each itinerary creation; we often found ourselves faced with monetary consequences because of the limited number of free calls allowed to the API per day.

## Working Together In The Future ##

If we were to start over, we would implement some of the following changes in our process:
* Substantial prototyping before coding anything for our user interface
* Extensive REST documentation agreed upon before development begins
* Standard conventions for the maintenance of our repo(s), probably in the form of Gitflow
* Greater focus on user story task breakdown and estimation
* Implementation of concrete front end design patttern(s)

It is likely that we would make further changes to our process, however, the five points above are what we deemed to be the most crucial changes. In general, our team views this project as a success and an excellent learning experience.
