# Krusty Krab: Planit - Competition

## Airbnb - https://www.airbnb.ca

Airbnb is an online market where people can rent out their properties to guests. It helps travelers find a place where they can stay for nights while on their trips, and for reasonable prices. Their app also has an 'explore' section where users can look for experiences, adventures and restaurants. In these sections, Airbnb provides a list of featured activities where you can view and book a date. 

What makes Planit different is that the activities it presents you are catered towards your preferences/filters. It will create an itinerary with these specific activities so that you are only visiting places you are interested in. Though Airbnb does provide the user with the ability to search for activities, it does not provide this unique personalization that Planit provides.

Airbnb and Planit both target travelers as their main audience but the apps both specialize in two different things. Airbnb is more focused on providing users with a way to rent places to stay on your trips whereas, Planit is more focused on planning the activities you will do on your trip.

Airbnb's online property market is such a unique feature that not many other apps are able to replicate. This is due to that fact that Airbnb is one of the most popular apps of its type therefore there are more people renting out their properties to guests using their app. If this is the key feature drawing people to use their app it is apparent why they focus more on this feature rather than an activity planning tool. If they wanted to create an activity planning tool like Planit, they would need to create an itinerary function in their app. Since they have the activities already in the app they would just need to add it to the itinerary. Although this would be a good first step, they would still need to implement the filter personalization that Planit has.

## TripAdvisor - https://www.tripadvisor.ca

TripAdvisor provides users with travel information, posting reviews and opinions on travel related content. It help travelers look at what other travelers think of hotels, restaurants and other travel-related content. On their website, you are able to look at reviews for hotels, activities, restaurants, flights, etc. 

Both Planit and TripAdvisor both allow the user to select when you will be traveling so that only the available activities during that time are shown. In both services, users are able to review each activity for others to see. Beyond this, TripAdvisor does cannot do much more. Planit provides the users with a quick way of adding these activities to the itinerary.

The target audience for TripAdvisor and Planit are travelers. They are both providing with users with a way to help decide which activities they would like to do during their trip. TripAdvisor is more focused on providing the user with a database of reviews for different activities to help users decide the activities they would like to do. Planit is more for providing users with a fast way for choosing activities based on user preferences.

TripAdvisor's review database is a single domain with honest and true reviews for almost everything related to travelling. This means that travelers only need to go to one place to see whether or not people enjoyed something or not. With such a large database with reviews, people can go to their website and easily find out whether a place or activity is worth going to. Since people find it important to read reviews when planning trips, they go to TripAdvisor with this large database. Since this is the main attraction of their product, they have focused much of their website on these reviews. TripAdvisor already allows the users to search for reviews in specific categories (shopping, nightlife, etc). In order to focus on the planning scenario as Planit, they could implement the ability to click on a review for a place and, if they want to visit, add it to a planner. Although the user would have to choose what they would like to do (which could take some time) it would at least allow users to create an itinerary.



## Pebblar - https://pebblar.com

Pebblar provides travelers with a visual workspace to create itineraries. You select your location, choose places you would like to go and then add dates to when you want to visit. Using Pebblar's visual workspace it makes creating itineraries quick and easy.

Pebblar is very similar to Planit. They both provide their target audience, travelers, with the ability to create an itinerary for their trips. With Pebblar, users will have to choose which places they would like to visit to add to their itinerary. This means that they will have to do research when making plans. With Planit, the itinerary is created for you based on the filters you have applied which makes planning much faster and easier for travelers.

Although Pebblar is missing this automatic itinerary creation tool, it is still a very popular choice when it comes to planning trips. This is due to the fact of its own unique workspace. It is a visual collaborative workspace that allows you to visually plan your trip. Allowing users to collaborate with others when planning trips which is very convenient and brings in more users. This workspace is the main feature of Pebblar and is what makes it so unique and is why Pebblar is focusing their attention towards it. In order to compete with Planit's itinerary, they would need to expand their destination filters (airport, hotels, etc). At the moment, the filters they have are general and it may take time for users to find what they are looking for.
