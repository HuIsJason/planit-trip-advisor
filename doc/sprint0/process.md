## Organization

We primarily used Facebook Messenger to communicate as a group. This proved to be an effective method to check up on progress, make minor decisions, and determine the best times for our in-person group meetings.

At the beginning of the sprint, we made some rough estimates as to how long each portion of the sprint would take to complete. Using these estimates, we determined the amount of time each person would be responsible for, and then we separated the tasks accordingly.

Because all seven of us will be filling the role of developer for this project (our product owner is Lora and Flora, and our scrum master is our TA), I will instead be defining what we worked on in sprint 0 and our plan for the next phase of the project.

Three people were assigned to create a user experience mockup/prototype as this required the most amount of time to complete. Using UXPin, Richard, Jason H., and Swarup were able to work on this mockup together.

Jackie was assigned to completing the competition and summary documents. Logan was assigned to completing the personas and writing the process document after the details of it were discussed as a group.

Jason C. and Hemant were responsible for completing the user stories and product backlog. Finally, everyone decided on what "done" meant, but Jason C. was responsible for the write-up.

In the next phase, we will split into front end and backend teams in order to begin development of Planit; we have tentatively decided that there will be three front-end developers and four back-end developers.

## Tools

1) Facebook messenger was used to organize a group chat
2) Microsoft Word was used to create the personas for this project
3) Strawpoll was used to help with planning poker
4) UXPin was used to create the prototype
5) Jira was used to organize the product backlog

## Decision Making

Decisions were primarily made during our group meetings, which occurred roughly once a week. This way, people in attendance were able to discuss, review, and form a majority opinion on important topics. Some minor decisions were made in the group chat; polls were used to determine what meeting times worked best for the group, and document formatting was discussed briefly at times.

## User Stories

The priority of user stories was defined using our initial conversations with the product owner. Flora outlined which functionalities she needed the application to have, while also providing us with an idea of which were not as crucial. 

In order to define point values for each story, we used planning poker and the Fibonacci sequence. For every story, roughly 3 rounds were required. During this process, it became clear that a number of the stories required clarification so that each of the members of our group could accurately determine how challenging they thought the task was going to be.

## Future Phases

As we progress through future sprints, it will be important for us to come up with more accurate estimates for the amount of time a task will take to complete. We underestimated the amount of time that the prototyping was going to take, and we also were surprised with how long planning poker took to complete. Over-estimation may be a valuable tool for us while deciding how much we are able to handle in each sprint.
